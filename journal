Today was the first day of classes. 
We met Dr. Pinzon, had some warm-up brain teasers, and then did a group scavenger hunt. 
My team finished first, but apparently the activity was not about winning.
We learned how to navigate files through the terminal, and set up GitHub on our computers.
I am hoping to switch to HL, because the course seems very interesting and organized.

Today we learned how to navigate the terminal using commands like cd, mkdir, and pwd.
I'm glad I learned a bit of this over the summer, because my throat is killing me and I still have to get through English.
We warmed up with TELOS, a system-planning acronym.
I tried to map out my computer files, and by doing so, learned that my files are a mess. So maybe someday I'll find the time to organize them.

Today we learned how to create basic programs.
We used commands like bash, read, and echo.
We also explored if/then expressions.
It was very interesting to see so much possibility from so few commands.

05/09/19
Today we looked at our ramen assignement and learned more about git.
We briefly saw arrays, which was scary.
Our textbook content today was about legacy programs, and we watched a short video on Y2K.

11/09/19
Today we played kahoot, looked at our adventure games, and learned about while loops.
I won the kahoot (obviously), and fixed a lot of issues in my program.
I finally learned the difference between single and double equal signs.
