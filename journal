Today was the first day of classes. 
We met Dr. Pinzon, had some warm-up brain teasers, and then did a group scavenger hunt. 
My team finished first, but apparently the activity was not about winning.
We learned how to navigate files through the terminal, and set up GitHub on our computers.
I am hoping to switch to HL, because the course seems very interesting and organized.
